# Outline for G

G is a universal graph database and trust network. Nodes can be People, Collectives, Events, Things or Ideas. Edges show the relationships between nodes. Nodes are created with very minimal data as they are defined in each constellation by their relationships to other nodes and their classifications.


There are 5 places you can be in G:

**Universe:** This is where nodes live. Nodes are commons property. Any user can create them but once created they are available for anyone else to use or link other realities to.

**Metaverse:** This is a second commons space where users create classification tables for node types and edge relationships. These classification tables are then available for anyone to use. 

**Constellations:** This is your own space or your team space. If you like, you can leave your constellation public for everyone to contribute to, or specify degrees of trust from the creator required for editing or add specific other editors. This is where you map relationships between nodes, add document sources and create your own graph and associated reporting.

**Galaxies:** These are essentially search results on constellations. Galaxies allow users to merge, filter and sort constellations into one combined graph.

**5th Dimension:** This is where user profiles live along with their trust networks.



**History:** Allows you to scroll back in time in any of the above places.

**Plugins:** Provide added functionality to any of the above spaces. Examples would be a blog or other reporting, scheduling or decision making software that can be plugged in at a user, consellation or galaxy level.


### Universe

#### Realities

G does not dictate an official reality. Each node can have multiple realities, linked in a hypernode. Reality types are T, L, P: Temporal, Linguistic, Perceptive. A node can be more than one type, ie L and T. The default is P.  Different temporal realities shows a change over time, different linguistic realities may relate to language or aliases, and different perceptive realities show different viewpoints on the same node. All realities are always viewable by tapping a node, but each constellation selects only one reality per node. Multiple realities of the same node may be used in a constellation; for instance all the temporal realities for one event can be pulled into a constellation to create a timeline. All the realities are referred to collectively as a hypernode.

* Type: P - default
* Type: L - search language constellation in metaverse, select language. Allow multiple realities of the same language.
* Type: T - do not allow exact duplicates, verify time is different on temporal. Temporal can be explicit (from and to date) or relative (if placed on a timeline.)



#### Node types

Nodetypes P E C T M I: Person, Event, Collective, Thing, Media, Idea, can only be one

* If P, input name
* If E or C, input name, description, geotags (associate geotags w date range, can be multiple sets)
* If T, input name, description, image
* If M, input keywords, title, description, 


### Constellations

Constellations include a fact or fiction toggle and users can elect to filter searches to show only those labeled as one or the other.

G is used as a group (even if it is a group of one). G is designed to encourage both collaboration and autonomy. While you can control your own constellation teams, anyone is able to view or copy your work and it will be linked to everyone else's work on the same topic through shared nodes. User profiles allow trust networks that will help filter spam and allow you to view work only within selected degrees of trust. Create / update / delete permissions in G are granted by constellation, not user. No one can delete a constellation unless they are the only user left with editing privileges.

Two constellations can elect to merge with each other. A merge will delete one constellation, combine the teams, and allow the editors to create one constellation from the two. 

All contributions to a constellation keep a record of the editor. Individual effort in a group is recognized individually. 


### Galaxies

Any constellations can be joined with any other constellations in a separate read-only Galaxy. This will just allow connections to be made between the graphs while each constellation maintains full autonomy. 


### G conventions

* Hover will display a static image
* Single click will display full data and allow editing if you have permission
* Double click will open a different part of G (Universe, Constellations, Galaxies or Metaverse)



A more detailed plan and Schedule of deliverables is being developed on the trello. More information is available here https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2015/12/24/getgee-tools-for-self-governance-part-1/ and here https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2016/04/25/transcript-from-talk-about-getgee/.
